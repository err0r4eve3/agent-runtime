# Step 5: Consistency Check + Report

Do NOT call `analyze_function_completeness` -- scoring is handled externally after this prompt completes.

## Consistency Checklist (required before reporting DONE)

Before finalizing, verify these alignments:

1. **Function name vs plate comment summary**: If you renamed the function, does the plate comment's first line (summary) still match? Update if stale.
2. **Function name vs plate comment Returns/Parameters**: Do the Returns and Parameters sections use terminology consistent with the new name?
3. **Prototype vs plate comment Parameters**: Do the parameter names and types in the plate comment match the actual prototype?
4. **Module prefix vs Source line**: If the function has a module prefix, does the Source: line reference a matching .cpp file?

If any mismatch is found: fix it via `batch_set_comments` (plate comment update) before reporting DONE.

## Variable Reconciliation (required before reporting DONE)

Call `get_function_variables()` one final time and check:

1. **No generic names remaining**: Every variable still named `[a-z]Var[0-9]+` or `local_*` must be renamed via `rename_variables()` or listed in Unresolved with justification.
2. **Prefix matches type**: Every renamed variable's Hungarian prefix must match its Ghidra type:
   - `p` prefix → must be a pointer type (ends with `*`)
   - `dw` prefix → must be `uint` or `ulong`
   - `n` prefix → must be `int` or `short`
   - `w` prefix → must be `ushort`
   - `sz` prefix → must be `char *`
   If a mismatch exists, fix the type with `set_local_variable_type()` OR fix the name with `rename_variables()`.
3. **Plate comment references applied**: If your plate comment's Special Cases or Parameters section names a variable differently from what's in `get_function_variables()`, apply the rename. Do not document names you didn't actually set.

## Report Format

```
DONE: FunctionName
Changes: [brief summary of what you changed]
Proven: [changes backed by callers, constants, or typed APIs]
Inferred: [names/types based on internal usage only -- not verified at call sites]
Unresolved: [structural limitations, phantom variables, unfixable items]
Consistency: [PASS or list of fixes applied]
```

## Known Unfixable Items (do not attempt)

If you encountered any of these during Steps 1-4, note them in your report but do not retry:
- Phantom variables (`extraout_*`, `in_*`) -- documented in plate comment
- Register-only SSA variables -- type set via PRE_COMMENT
- `__thiscall` ECX `this` pointer -- cannot be retyped via API, documented in plate comment
- void* on exported/thunk functions -- structural limitation
